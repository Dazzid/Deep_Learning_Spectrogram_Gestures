# Deep_Learning_Spectrogram_Gestures

Detecting patterns from Mel-Spectrograms extracted from gestural excercices perfomed by expert violinists. 

We used: 
- Python '3.6.8' 
- TensorFlow '2.0.0' 
- NumPy '1.17.4' 
- Scikit-learn '0.23.1' 
- Pyquaternion '0.9.5'.

## Music Score
8 Gestures were recorded by professional violinist and students in the Royal College of Music in London.
